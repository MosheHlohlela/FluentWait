# Selenium Fluent Wait Example (Java)
This project demonstrates how to use **Fluent Wait in Selenium** with **Java** to handle dynamic elements on a web page.
The test waits for an element to appear by checking repeatedly at fixed intervals instead of waiting blindly.

Scenario
- Open a test website with dynamic loading
- Click the **Start** button
- Wait until the hidden text appears
- Print the text in the console
- Close the browser
